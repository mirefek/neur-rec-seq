# openAI gym environments for recursive puzzles

The puzzles are not meant to be solved in their standard way
but rather to accomplish partial objectives.

* `Recursive-Hanoi-v0`: the classical tower of Hanoi with 7 discs
* `Recursice-Bottles-v0`: inspired by 6 Bottles puzzle by Jean Claude Constantin (with 7 bottles)
